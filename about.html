title: About Me
---

I'm a second year student at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario. <br><br>
I currently lead the <a href="http://wits.csd.uwo.ca">Women in Tech</a> Society at my school. <br><br>
I'm passionate about creating and coding. Feel free to check out my projects on GitHub or get in contact with me.
