At Square's College Code Camp in August 2014, participants were asked to build an app that raised awareness for the charity <a href="https://red.org/">(RED)</a>. 

<br><br>

Inspired by the success of that summer's ALS Ice Bucket Challenge on social media, my partner <a href="http://www.bethanytdavis.com/">Bethany Davis</a> and I built <a href="https://github.com/shirleymiao/sha-red-">Filte(red)</a>: a tool that overlays (RED)'s iconic red brackets onto a user-uploaded photo, and allows the resulting image to be exported to Twitter.
<br><br>
We ultimately won the hackathon, selected as the best project that represented (RED) and helped it achieve its goals.
