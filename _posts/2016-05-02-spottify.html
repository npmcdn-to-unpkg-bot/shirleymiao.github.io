[Work in progress]<br><br>

The idea here is to create a sychronized listening app that uses Spotify's newly released Android SDK and a Node.js server running an instance of Socket.IO to allow users to listen to a synchronized playlist with their friends. At any point in time, any user in the room can change the track, add a new track to the currently playing list, and play/pause the music.
