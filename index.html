I'm a second year student at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario. <br><br>
I've been recognized as a <a href="http://www.registrar.uwo.ca/student_finances/scholarships_awards/national_scholarship_program.html">Western President's Scholar</a>, Square <a href="https://squareup.com/code-camp/college">College Code Camp</a> participant, and <a href="http://www.uwo.ca/research/funding/students/nserc_usra_overview.html">NSERC-USRA</a> research fellow. In addition, I currently lead the <a href="http://wits.csd.uwo.ca">Women in Tech</a> Society at my school. <br><br>
I'm passionate about creating and coding. Feel free to check out my projects on GitHub or get in contact with me.
